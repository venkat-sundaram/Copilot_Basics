## Features

### Code Generation Examples
- **Shell Scripting**: File processing and optimization techniques
- **Palindrome Detection**: Algorithm implementations in multiple languages
- **Data Structure Visualization**: Entity-relationship diagrams and analysis

### Copilot Integration
- Custom instructions for consistent code generation
- Documentation guidelines for clear communication
- Best practices for AI-assisted development

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/venkat-sundaram/Copilot_Basics.git
   cd Copilot_Basics
   ```

2. **Explore the examples**:
   - Review shell scripts in the `Refactor/` directory
   - Examine vision-based exercises in the `Vision/` directory
   - Read Copilot configuration in `.github/copilot-instructions.md`

3. **Try the code**:
   ```bash
   # Run shell script examples
   chmod +x Refactor/Example_Optimize.sh
   ./Refactor/Example_Optimize.sh
   ```

## Code Samples

### Palindrome Detection (Python)
```python
def is_palindrome(s):
    """Check if a string is a palindrome, ignoring case and punctuation."""
    cleaned = ''.join(char.lower() for char in s if char.isalnum())
    return cleaned == cleaned[::-1]

# Example usage
print(is_palindrome("A man a plan a canal Panama"))  # True
```

### File Processing (Bash)
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Count lines in all .txt files
for file in $(find . -type f -name "*.txt"); do
    wc -l "$file"
done
```
